            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <p class="steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Cut sweet potatoes into 2” cubes. In a large bowl, toss the sweet potatoes with olive oil and taco seasoning. Arrange on a baking sheet, careful not to overcrowd. Roast on the center rack in oven for 30 minutes, flipping the sweet potatoes half way through. (If sweet potatoes aren't tender enough, cook for an additional 5 minutes.)</li>
                    <li>In a high-powered blender, blend all ingredients for the dressing. You should end up with about 1 ¼ cups of the vegan cilantro-lime dressing.(For a thinner dressing add a little more lime juice)</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, toss the kale, cilantro, green onions, black beans, roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, with desired amount of dressing. Enjoy!  
                    </li>

            <h3>Recipe Website Inspo:</h3>
            <p><a href="https://themodernproper.com/">The Modern Proper</a> is a good website because they organize recipes by meal and by dietary restrictions. At the top of each recipe they give an overview with helpful information such as cook and prep times. They even have a useful hyperlink to jump to the recipe part of the page so you can skip reading the boring story all recipe recipes seem to have.</p>
            <p><a href="https://deliciouslyella.com/">Deliciously Ella</a> makes it easy to see exactly what the recipes look like. You browse the recipe catalog by images with smaller subheadings. Each recipe is neatly condensed to the center of the page making it very easy to get all the information you need. It is concise and to the point.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://rainbowplantlife.com/">Rainbow Plant Life</a> has a great search tool to streamline your recipe search. Under the recipe page of the website there are drop down tabs that let you sort recipes by category, diet, or season. There are also subpages that divide the recipes by meal time. At the top of each meal time page there is a suggested or highlighted recipe enlarged at the top. This visual hierarchy gives the viewer a suggestion, potentially inspiring them to make that recipe.</p>
            <h3>Non-Recipe Website Inspo:</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.asos.com/us/women/">Asos</a> is a good example of effective communication that caters to their shoppers personal needs. If you click on a specific clothing item on the website, below the item details are "you might also like," "buy the look," and "recently viewed" scroll bars that allow the viewer to click through and view other items that is unique to their experience using the site.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> has the useful feature of allowing you to create folders on your page. You can then add content from the website to these folders. This could be a useful application to a recipe website because the user could add recipes they want to try to a folder they make on their personal profile, allowing their user experience to stay within the website. In the past I usually just copy the recipe link to an outside document, so I feel this feature could be very helpful.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> landing page uses visual hierarchy to divide up relevant news articles. There are a bunch of recent/featured articles displayed in a grid-like format with some of the grid squares bigger than others, giving preference to the bigger articles. This could be a good visual hierarchy to apply to a website with lots of recipes.</p>
