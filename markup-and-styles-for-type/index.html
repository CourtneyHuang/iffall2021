                   <p> Common inline elements include: </p>
                   <a href="#">a</a>, <strong>strong</strong>, <em>em</em>, <b>b</b>, <i>i</i>, <sup>sup</sup>, <sub>sub</sub>, <button>button</button>, <code>code</code>, and <span>span</span>.

                   <p> common block elements include: </p>
                   <p>p</p>, <h1>h1</h1>, <h2>h2</h2>, <h3>h3</h3>, <h4>h4</h4>, <h5>h5</h5>, <h6>h6</h6>, <article>article</article>, <section>section</section>, <nav>nav</nav>, <aside>aside</aside>, <header>header</header>, <footer>footer</footer>, and <div>div</div>

                   <p> this is a paragraph, I'm going to wrap it like a paragraph by using the p tag. </p>

                   <!-- code comments: away to write something into the code that is totally ignored by the browser. Its like a personal note that just exists in VS code. if u hit command and then question mark it will make a code comment for u. -->

                   <p> the meta charset is put before the title. should get in the habit of putting that in every doc u create. FYI no visible change.</p>
                   <p>greater than and less than signs must be represented by html entities. (&lt; and &gt;)</p>
                   <p>absolute units in ur style sheets set something in stone, relative units are based on another set item</p>
                   <p>the rem unit is the documents base font size. in this case its 15pt</p>
                   <p>superscripted elemetn with rem sizing: 16 <sup>th</sup> century</p>
                   <p>em is a unit of type that is equal to the font size ur currently using, diff from rem bc em is measured to the parent element thats being styled instead of the base document font size. really useful when ur scaling type and want it to stay proportional to the type thats around it</p>
                   <p> <dfn> font-weight, by using a definition tag im making this bold</dfn></p>
                   <p class="italics">font style is really just to set if its italics or not</p>
                   <p>for font height u dont need to specify a unit, the default will assume its a multiplier of the font size. so if u have 1 and ur font size is 13pt then that is gonna b ur line height.</p>
                   <p class="text-alignright">on sited elements do text-align right.</p>

                   <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>

                   <!-- use margin as percentages bc it will scale up and down accordingly -->

                   <!-- getting rid of the text decoration on the anchor tags got rid of the underline -->

                   <!-- text transform is how u can force the capitlization rule on type  -->
