        <h1>Get to know me! Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Courtney Huang, Junior majoring in Visual Communication Design.</p>
        <p>2. I come from an art and design background. I needed to take this class for the com des major but also feel this is a valuable skill to learn.</p>
        <p>3. I have no experience with html, css, or js.</p>
        <p>4. I hope in this class I can learn these programs to apply to my design and to understand better the foundations of interaction design and web development.</p>
        <p>5. Designing for screen seems different than paper because the coding or writing of code in html is like the middle man. You have to learn how to translate what you want the end product to look like through writing in the program first instead of just being able to sketch out what you want by hand.</p>
        <p>6. https://www.printmag.com I think the design of the Print Magazine website is very effective through its use of visual hierarchy to help the viewer navigate the page. Each landing page highlights featured articles at the top and are a bigger size and all other articles are listed below in grid format. The menu at the top of the website also divides it up by section/topic to better help find what you are looking for. These aspects use design to make the user experience easier. </p>
        <p>7. https://www.studiomoross.com/ This is the website for the graphic design firm Studio Moross. I think it effectively communicates it purpose because the opening page immediately displays their work and even autoplays clips of animated or video projects instead of just a thumbnail from them. The side bar on the website also allows you to narrow your search of projects and makes it easier for clients to find out if Studio Moross can produce the kind of work they're looking for.</p>
        <p>8. https://opensource.glassanimals.com/ The website for the band Glass Animals works well because it is very reflective of the band and genre of music they produce. The site mimicks an old desktop browser. The music glass animals makes is kind of techno and alternative and a lot of these album cover art holds similar influences to the design of their website.</p>
